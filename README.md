This is an in-situ HTML editor. It works on Firefox, Chrome or IE9. It doesn't work on IE8 (I decided supporting 8 wasn't worth the effort). I haven't tested any other browsers.

Demo: http://www.darktrojan.net/tools/pageedit/demo/editblocks.html

Currently it is capable of:

* block formatting selection (ie. <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <p>)
* bold, italic and underline
* text alignment
* links (wire in your own code with a callback)
* unordered and numeric lists
* images (again, wire in your own callback)

The icons in this repo are from [famfamfam.com's silk collection](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/). Just thought you should know.
